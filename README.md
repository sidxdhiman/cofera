# Cofera

Cofera is a cloud-based collaborative coding platform designed to let developers create, share, and run code inside powerful online workspaces called Pods.

Instead of installing local environments or sharing files manually, users can instantly spin up a Pod — a secure, isolated coding environment in the cloud — and collaborate with others in real time.

Each Pod supports:
- Live multi-user code editing
- Instant synchronization
- Server-side code execution
- Built-in communication
- Secure container-based isolation

Cofera combines the flexibility of a cloud IDE with the power of real-time collaboration and containerized execution.

The goal of Cofera is to simplify collaborative development by making coding:
- Accessible from anywhere
- Fast to start
- Secure by design
- Built for teams

It is not just an online editor — it is a collaborative coding ecosystem.
